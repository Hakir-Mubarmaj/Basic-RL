This project is an **interactive reinforcement learning (RL) model** that learns about the world **step by step** as you interact with it. It stores facts, asks questions, and refines its knowledge using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** and a **knowledge graph**.

## ğŸš€ Features
- ğŸ§  **Learns dynamically** from user input.
- ğŸ“š **Stores and retrieves knowledge** using a knowledge graph.
- ğŸ”„ **Refines its responses** based on reinforcement learning.
- ğŸ“ˆ **Improves over time** through memory replay.
